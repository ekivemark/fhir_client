# Local.ini 

Local.ini contains the unique values to be incorporated in to _start/settings.py 
for the specific machine installation. This file is excluded from git to avoid overwriting 
machine configurations.

## Machine specific installation

Create a local.ini text file on each machine and define using unique values. 

local.ini is deliberatly excluded from the github repository so passwords or keys 
can be included in the file and used to override default values in settings.py.
